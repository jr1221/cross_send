# cross_send

Send files from android to iphone WITHOUT uploading them to the internet

## Features

- Quickly send photos between users with QR enabled tech
- Any other file supported, sent right to your Download folder if it is not a photo or video
- No cloud uploads, all data transfer is done locally, so bandwidth and privacy is saved
- Full quality and (almost) all EXIF metadata is transferred
- Files never get to ANY server, this app does not communicate with the world outside of the other phone

Cons:
- must be on the same wifi network as the recipient
- cannot keep file names for pictures or videos sent to camera roll (often just random numbers anyway)
